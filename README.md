# UgandaTweets
Using Scheme for sentimental analysis of Uganda Tweets
The abstractions have also been used for analysis Twitter data see http://www.nicholasvanhorn.com/posts/trump-tweets.html. 
For this project we built a set of abstractions that can be used by developers to build software systems that analyze 
the moods of tweets for a given country (e.g., Uganda) over a periodof 12 months.
We assume that locality information provided by Twitter API is accurate.
